               <p>
                  Aka. Wilson Fisk
                  Wilson Fisk, who publicly acts as a philanthropist and
                  legitimate businessman, secretly controls New York City’s
                  organized crime families as the feared Kingpin.
                  I spent years trying to incriminate him and finally does so –
                  only to quickly learn that maybe Fisk was right when he said,
                  “I’m the one who brought order to this city!”

                  Granted superhuman strength by artificially crafted skin,
                  Aleksei Sytsevich wants to shed the protective coverings and
                  thuggish reputation as the Rhino.

               <p>
                  Aka. MacDonal Gargan <br>
                  Frustrated, Jameson decided to pay $10,000 to Gargan to be
                  the subject of an experiment. The experiment, created by
                  Dr. Farley Stillwell, a researcher in animal mutation,
                  which endowed the subject with the characteristic of another animal.
                  Unfortunately the process resulted in the loss of Gargan's sanity,
                  and the creation of the super-powered criminal
                  menace known as the Scorpion.

                  He gained the ability to control electricity after being struck by
                  lightning while working on a power line.
                  Electro has since become one of my most enduring foes,
                  becoming part of the collective rogue team known as the Sinister Six.

                  Aka. Adrian Toomes<br>
                  Vulture has vexed me with his lethal flight suit since when I first learned
                  to channel his web-slinging abilities. Now Adrian Toomes suffers from spinal cancer
                  due to the power produced from his winged rig.

                  What’s the best way to rob a bank? Herman Schultz
                  prefers to literally shock and awe,
                  using a high-tech suit with gauntlets that blast intense vibrational waves
                  to crush vaults and elude the police.
